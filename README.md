## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are essential for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository includes detailed implementations of common data structures and algorithms, making it easier to understand their workings and applications.

## Data Structures

### 1. Arrays
- **Description**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
- **Example**: Basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### 2. Linked Lists
- **Description**: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next.
- **Includes**: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List.

### 3. Stacks
- **Description**: A collection of elements that supports last-in, first-out (LIFO) access.
- **Methods**: Push, Pop, Peek.

### 4. Queues
- **Description**: A collection of elements that supports first-in, first-out (FIFO) access.
- **Includes**: Circular Queue, Priority Queue.

### 5. Trees
- **Description**: A hierarchical structure consisting of nodes.
- **Includes**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and more.

### 6. Graphs
- **Description**: A collection of nodes and edges.
- **Includes**: Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix representations.

## Algorithms

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**

### 2. Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### 3. Graph Algorithms
